limit [ -hs ] [ resource [ limit ] ] ...
       Set or display resource limits.  Unless the -s  flag  is  given,
       the  limit  applies  only  the  children of the shell.  If -s is
       given without other arguments, the resource limits of  the  cur-
       rent  shell  is set to the previously set resource limits of the
       children.

       If limit is not specified, print the  current  limit  placed  on
       resource,  otherwise  set  the limit to the specified value.  If
       the -h flag is given, use hard limits instead  of  soft  limits.
       If no resource is given, print all limits.

       resource can be one of:

       addressspace
              Maximum amount of address space used.
       aiomemorylocked
              Maximum  amount  of  memory  locked in RAM for AIO opera-
              tions.
       aiooperations
              Maximum number of AIO operations.
       cachedthreads
              Maximum number of cached threads.
       coredumpsize
              Maximum size of a core dump.
       cputime
              Maximum CPU seconds per process.
       datasize
              Maximum data size (including stack) for each process.
       descriptors
              Maximum value for a file descriptor.
       filesize
              Largest single file allowed.
       maxproc
              Maximum number of processes.
       maxpthreads
              Maximum number of threads per process.
       memorylocked
              Maximum amount of memory locked in RAM.
       memoryuse
              Maximum resident set size.
       resident
              Maximum resident set size.
       sockbufsize
              Maximum size of all socket buffers.
       stacksize
              Maximum stack size for each process.
       vmemorysize
              Maximum amount of virtual memory.

       Which of these resource limits are available depends on the sys-
       tem.  resource can be abbreviated to any unambiguous prefix.

       limit is a number, with an optional scaling factor, as follows:

       nh     hours
       nk     kilobytes (default)
       nm     megabytes or minutes
       [mm:]ss
              minutes and seconds
