exit [ n ]
       Exit  the  shell  with  the exit code specified by n; if none is
       specified, use the exit code from the last command executed.  An
       EOF  condition  will  also  cause  the shell to exit, unless the
       IGNORE EOF option is set.

bye    Same as exit.

logout [ n ]
       Same as exit, except that it only works in a login shell.
