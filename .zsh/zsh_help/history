fc [ -e ename ] [ -nlrdDfEim ] [ old=new ... ] [ first [ last ] ]
fc -ARWI [ filename ]
       Select  a  range of commands from first to last from the history
       list.  The arguments first and last may be specified as a number
       or  as  a string.  A negative number is used as an offset to the
       current history event  number.   A  string  specifies  the  most
       recent event beginning with the given string.  All substitutions
       old=new, if any, are then performed on the commands.

       If the -l flag is given, the resulting commands  are  listed  on
       standard  output.   If the -m flag is also given the first argu-
       ment is taken as a pattern (should be quoted) and only the  his-
       tory  events matching this pattern will be shown.  Otherwise the
       editor program ename is invoked on a file containing these  his-
       tory  events.  If ename is not given, the value of the parameter
       FCEDIT is used.  If ename is `-', no editor  is  invoked.   When
       editing is complete, the edited command is executed.

       If first is not specified, it will be set to -1 (the most recent
       event), or to -16 if the -l flag is given.  If last is not spec-
       ified,  it  will  be  set  to  first, or to -1 if the -l flag is
       given.

       The flag -r reverses the order of the commands and the  flag  -n
       suppresses  command numbers when listing.  Also when listing, -d
       prints timestamps for each command, and -f prints full time-date
       stamps.   Adding  the  -E flag causes the dates to be printed as
       `dd.mm.yyyy', instead of the default `mm/dd/yyyy'.   Adding  the
       -i  flag  causes the dates to be printed in ISO8601 `yyyy-mm-dd'
       format.  With the -D flag, fc prints elapsed times.

       `fc -R' reads the history from the given file,  `fc  -W'  writes
       the  history out to the given file, and `fc -A' appends the his-
       tory out to the given file.  If no filename  is  specified,  the
       $HISTFILE  is  assumed.   If  the -I option is added to -R, only
       those events that are not already contained within the  internal
       history  list are added.  If the -I option is added to -A or -W,
       only  those  events  that  are  new   since   last   incremental
       append/write  to  the history file are appended/written.  In any
       case, the created file will have no more than $SAVEHIST entries.
