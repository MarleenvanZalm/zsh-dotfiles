enable [ -afmr ] name ...
       Enable the named hash table elements, presumably  disabled  ear-
       lier  with  disable.  The default is to enable builtin commands.
       The -a option causes enable to act on aliases.   The  -f  option
       causes  enable  to act on shell functions.  The -r option causes
       enable to act on reserved words.  Without arguments all  enabled
       hash  table  elements  from  the  corresponding  hash  table are
       printed.  With the -m flag the arguments are taken  as  patterns
       (should  be  quoted) and all hash table elements from the corre-
       sponding  hash  table  matching  these  patterns  are   enabled.
       Enabled  objects  can  be disabled with the disable builtin com-
       mand.
