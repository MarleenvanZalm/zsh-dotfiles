setopt [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o option name ] [ name ... ]
       Set  the  options  for  the shell.  All options specified either
       with flags or by name are set.  If no  arguments  are  supplied,
       the  names  of all options currently set are printed.  If the -m
       flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns (which  should
       be  quoted  to  protect  them  from filename expansion), and all
       options with names matching these patterns are set.
